# Fidibo Blog (ðŸš§ Under Development)

Welcome to the Fidibo Blog project. This site is being developed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator.

## Installation

To get started, follow the [Hugo installation guide](https://gohugo.io/installation) to set up Hugo on your machine.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

This will start a local server with drafts enabled, allowing you to preview your content in real-time.

## Publishing a Post

To publish a new post:

1. Navigate to the `content/posts` directory.
2. Create a new folder with a **unique** slug name (this will be used as the URL for your post).
3. Inside this folder:
   - Create an `index.md` file to write your content.
   - Add any associated images within the same folder.

A sample post (`sample-post.md`) is available in the root of the project to help you get started.

## Built with Hugo
